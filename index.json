However, previous work has shown that this is not always true. To further understand this phenomenon, we develop a unified comparison of the asymptotic variance of a class of linear regression-adjusted estimators. Our analysis is based on the classical theory for linear regression with heteroscedastic errors and thus does not assume that the postulated linear model is correct. For a completely randomized binary treatment, we provide sufficient conditions under which some regression-adjusted estimators are guaranteed to be more asymptotically efficient than others. We explore other settings such as general treatment assignment mechanisms and generalized linear models, and find that the variance dominance phenomenon no longer occurs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A unified analysis of regression adjustment in randomized experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Reluga","María José Lombardía","Stefan Sperlich"],"categories":null,"content":"s\n","date":1663459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663459200,"objectID":"afa731591fd4175f4529c3f8f87e9c82","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/publication/reluga-isr/","publishdate":"2022-09-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reluga-isr/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past decades, linear mixed models have attracted considerable attention in various fields of applied statistics. They are popular whenever clustered, hierarchical or longitudinal data are investigated. Nonetheless, statistical tools for valid simultaneous inference for mixed parameters are rare. This is surprising because one often faces inferential problems beyond the pointwise examination of fixed or mixed parameters. For example, there is an interest in a comparative analysis of cluster-level parameters or subject-specific estimates in studies with repeated measurements. We discuss methods for simultaneous inference assuming a linear mixed model. Specifically, we develop simultaneous prediction intervals as well as multiple testing procedures for mixed parameters. They are useful for joint considerations or comparisons of cluster-level parameters. We employ a consistent bootstrap approximation of the distribution of max-type statistic to construct our tools. The numerical performance of the developed methodology is studied in simulation experiments and illustrated in a data example on household incomes in small areas.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Simultaneous inference for linear mixed model parameters with an application to small area estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Reluga","Stefan Sperlich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658707200,"objectID":"af728bdf5754a2601faf76dba1b26de4","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/publication/reluga-ss/","publishdate":"2022-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reluga-ss/","section":"publication","summary":"Linear mixed effects are considered excellent predictors of cluster-level parameters in various domains. However, previous work has shown that their performance can be seriously affected by departures from modelling assumptions. Since the latter are common in applied studies, there is a need for inferential methods which are to certain extent robust to misspecifications, but at the same time simple enough to be appealing for practitioners. We construct statistical tools for cluster-wise and simultaneous inference for mixed effects under model misspecification using straightforward semiparametric random effect bootstrap. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our methods are asymptotically consistent under general regularity conditions. In simulations our intervals were robust to severe departures from model assumptions and performed better than their competitors in terms of empirical coverage probability.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Simple bootstrap for linear mixed effects under model misspecification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657238400,"objectID":"fac44df4fca1eabc25934afaa0b9b288","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/talk/post-selection-inference-for-linear-mixed-models/","publishdate":"2022-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/post-selection-inference-for-linear-mixed-models/","section":"event","summary":"While the post-selection inference has received considerable attention in linear and generalized linear models, it seems to be a neglected topic in the field of mixed models and mixed effect predictions. Therefore we have developed a complete asymptotic theory for post-selection inference within the framework of linear mixed models once the conditional Akaike information criterion was employed as a model selection procedure. Our theory is then used to construct confidence intervals for regression parameters, linear statistics and mixed effects under different scenarios, nested and general model sets as well as sets composed only of misspecified models. The theoretical analysis is accompanied by a simulation study which confirms a good performance of our procedures. Moreover, our simulations reveal a startling robustness of the classical confidence intervals for a mixed parameter. This is in contrast to findings for the fixed parameters and may indicate that, under certain scenarios, random effects would automatically adjust for model selection.

We develop new procedures for the estimation of heterogeneous area-specific average treatment effects at the small area level in observational studies. In particular, we use nonparametric machine learning (ML) methods which are ubiquitous in causal inference as they excel in terms of modelling flexibility and predictive abilities.

We therefore develop simultaneous confidence intervals and multiple testing procedures for empirical best predictors under GLMM. In addition, we implement our methodology to study widely employed examples of mixed models, that is, the unit-level binomial, the area-level Poisson-gamma and the area-level Poisson-lognormal mixed models.
