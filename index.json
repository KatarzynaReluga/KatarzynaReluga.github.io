This study leverages EU-SILC survey and census data to estimate the causal effect of job stability on monetary poverty across Italian provinces, quantifying its influence and analyzing regional disparities. We introduce a novel causal small area estimation (CSAE) framework that integrates global and local estimation strategies for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, effectively addressing data sparsity at the provincial level. Furthermore, we develop a general bootstrap scheme to construct reliable confidence intervals, applicable regardless of the method used for estimating nuisance parameters. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed estimators outperform classical causal inference methods in terms of stability while maintaining computational scalability for large datasets. Applying this methodology to real-world data, we uncover significant relationships between job stability and poverty across six Italian regions, offering critical insights into regional disparities and their implications for evidence-based policy design.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The impact of job stability on monetary poverty in Italy -- causal small area estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Josh Givens","Henry W J Reeve","Song Liu","Katarzyna Reluga"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1729036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1729036800,"objectID":"4c3f95d8d4612ace926d4ccce1ca2005","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/publication/reluga-jg/","publishdate":"2024-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reluga-jg/","section":"publication","summary":"Conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) can provide insight into the effect of a treatment beyond the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). This ability to provide information over multiple quantiles of the response makes CQTE especially valuable in cases where the effect of a treatment is not well-modelled by a location shift, even conditionally on the covariates. Nevertheless, the estimation of CQTE is challenging and often depends upon the smoothness of the individual quantiles as a function of the covariates rather than smoothness of the CQTE itself. This is in stark contrast to CATE where it is possible to obtain high-quality estimates which have less dependency upon the smoothness of the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth. Moreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the interpretability of smoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable assumption to make. We combine the desirable properties of CATE and CQTE by considering a new estimand, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC not only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to CQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to leverage simplicity in an auxiliary estimand. We provide finite sample bounds on the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit simplicity. We validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method produces more accurate estimates than baselines. Finally, we apply our methodology to a study on the effect of employment incentives on earnings across different age groups. We see that our method is able to reveal heterogeneity of the effect across different quantiles.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Conditional Outcome Equivalence A Quantile Alternative to CATE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katarzyna Reluga","María José Lombardía","Stefan Sperlich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719792000,"objectID":"af728bdf5754a2601faf76dba1b26de4","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/publication/reluga-ss/","publishdate":"2024-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reluga-ss/","section":"publication","summary":"Linear mixed effects are considered excellent predictors of cluster-level parameters in various domains. However, previous research has demonstrated that their performance is affected by departures from model assumptions. Given the common occurrence of these departures in empirical studies, there is a need for inferential methods that are robust to misspecifications while remaining accessible and appealing to practitioners. Statistical tools have been developed for cluster-wise and simultaneous inference for mixed effects under distributional misspecifications, employing a user-friendly semiparametric random effect bootstrap. The merits and limitations of this approach are discussed in the general context of model misspecification. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the asymptotic consistency of the methods under general regularity conditions. Simulations show that the proposed intervals are robust to departures from modelling assumptions, including asymmetry and long tails in the distributions of errors and random effects, outperforming competitors in terms of empirical coverage probability. Finally, the methodology is applied to construct confidence intervals for household income across counties in the Spanish region of Galicia.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bootstrap-based statistical inference for linear mixed effects under misspecifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1711065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711065600,"objectID":"4513cecbe726ad76c4a3773ffe496cd2","permalink":"https://KatarzynaReluga.github.io/talk/the-impact-of-job-stability-on-monetary-poverty-in-italy-causal-small-area-estimation/","publishdate":"2024-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/the-impact-of-job-stability-on-monetary-poverty-in-italy-causal-small-area-estimation/","section":"event","summary":"Job stability refers to the security and predictability of employment, including factors such as long-term contracts, adequate wages, social security benefits, and access to training and career development opportunities.

In this work, we leverage the EU-SILC survey and census data to assess the causal effect of job stability on monetary poverty across provinces in Italy. To this end, we propose a causal small area estimation (CSAE) framework for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in which only a negligible fraction of outcomes is actually observed at the provincial level. Our estimators are more stable than the classical causal inference tools as they borrow strength from the other sources of data at the expense of additional modelling assumptions.

Our analysis is based on the classical theory for linear regression with heteroscedastic errors and thus does not assume that the postulated linear model is correct. For a completely randomized binary treatment, we provide sufficient conditions under which some regression-adjusted estimators are guaranteed to be more asymptotically efficient than others.

They are popular whenever clustered, hierarchical or longitudinal data are investigated. Nonetheless, statistical tools for valid simultaneous inference for mixed parameters are rare. This is surprising because one often faces inferential problems beyond the pointwise examination of fixed or mixed parameters. For example, there is an interest in a comparative analysis of cluster-level parameters or subject-specific estimates in studies with repeated measurements. We discuss methods for simultaneous inference assuming a linear mixed model. Specifically, we develop simultaneous prediction intervals as well as multiple testing procedures for mixed parameters. They are useful for joint considerations or comparisons of cluster-level parameters. We employ a consistent bootstrap approximation of the distribution of max-type statistic to construct our tools.
